## Why would I use this?


## Installation

If you're working directly in a Package, add `PACKAGE` to your Package.swift file

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/JARMourato/PACKAGE.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
]
```

If working in an Xcode project select `File->Add Packages...` and search for the package name: `PACKAGE` or the git url:

`https://github.com/JARMourato/PACKAGE.git`
