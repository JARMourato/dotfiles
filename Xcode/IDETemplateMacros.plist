	<!-- When the file being created is in the main project, it contains the "Organization" information,
	     so it's possible to use the ___COPYRIGHT___ macro. However, when creating files outside the main
	     project, that info is not available, thus it would create broken headers. This is why we're using
	     this hardcoded version of the macro, just using a dynamic __YEAR__ macro. -->
